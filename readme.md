Welcome to the repo for my project Analyzing Reddit Behaviour.
Inside the docs folder you'll find the User Manual, the Technical Manual and a video walkthrough of how it looked when it was hosted.
Inside the src folder you'll find the project itself. The app is mainly contained within the app.py file and the UI components are within the Templates folder.
